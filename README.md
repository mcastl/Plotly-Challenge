# Plotly-Challenge
This challenge consists on building an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## General info
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Features
* The dashboard updates all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

To-do list:
* Improve code and format. 

## Status
Project is: _finished_, _subject to improvement_.

## Inspiration
Project based on Data Analytics BootCamp homeworks.
